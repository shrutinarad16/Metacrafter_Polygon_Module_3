Imagine that you wake up, check your email, and you see an interesting task: Polygon is asking you to design a new zkSNARK circuit that implements some logical operations. You need to implement the circuit and deploy a verifier on-chain to verify proofs generated from this circuit

For this project, you will create a circuit using the circom programming language that implements the following logical gate:
